# Scientific Revolution

> New philosophy calls all in doubt
> The element of fire is quite put out;
> the sun is lost, and th' Earth, and no man's wit
> Can well direct him where to looke for it
> And freely men confesse that this world's spent
> When in the Planets, and the new firmament
> They seeke so many new; then see that this
> Is crumbled out againe to his Atomies
> 'Tis all in peeces, all coherance gone;
> All just supply, and all Relation
>  
>  John Donne _The Anatomy of the World_
## Cause
  - Discovery of the New World
     - Discovery of new plant and animal life encouraged greater interest in the natural sciences
     - link between navigation and astronomy

   - Invention of the Printing Press
     - Scientific knowledge spread much more rapidly. People are informed
  - Rivalry Among Nation-States
    - constant warfare increased the demand for advancement in technologies
    - powerful leaders fund scientific developments
    - Europe vs. China: China's technological development is slower with less competitors 

  - Reformation
    - Theory:
      - Max Weber: Protestantism helped create capitalism
      - Protestantism was linked to new science developers
      - Rebuttal: New science is rooted in Catholic Italy
    - Encourage people to read Bible, which create a larger reading public
    - Example of challenging established authority

   - Renaissance Humanism

## Pre-Scientific Worldview ( Medieval )
    
   - Theory: scholasticism
   - Architect: Thomas Aquinas
   - Science: harmonized works of Aristotle and the teachings of the church
   - Role of science: better way to understand God
   - Four elements theory: 
     - the world was made up of four elements: earth, water, air and fire
     - the human body was made up of four elements: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile
   - Astronomy: Ptolemy's Geocentric system without question. Epicycles explained the motion of the planets in relation to the fixed stars.

## The Corpernican Revolution

 - Nicholas Copernicus (1473-1543)
   - _Concerning the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres_
   - Polish
   - He waited many years before he finally decided to publish, and he claimed that the Heliocentric theory was just mere hypothesis.

After Copernicus
    - Tycho Brache
    theory: moon and the sun revolved around the Earth, while the other planets revolved around the sun
    - Johannes Kepler
     theory: orbits were elliptical

 - Galileo
   - _Dialogues on the Two Chief Systems of the World_ (1632)
   - telescope
     - moon has mountainous similar surface with earth
     - stars are bigger than planets
     - sunspots and rings around Saturn
     - Jupiter had four moons of her own, which challenged the traditional notion of the unique relationship between Earth and moon
   - Motion
   Heavier weights do not fall faster than lighter ones
   A body in motion would tend to stay in motion under ideal conditions

 - Sir Isaac Newton
 - ==_principia_==
 - discovery
   -  gravity
   - experiment with optics
   - differential calculus
 - status: head of the British Royal Society
 - Religion

## Medical
  - William Harvey: circulation of blood

## Implact of Scientific Revolution on Philosophes

  Francis Bacon
    - Inductive reasoning, or empiricism: examine evidence from nature rather than rely on tradition.
