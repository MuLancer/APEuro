# Renaissance

## Overview
> Fifteenth- and sixteenth-century intellectuals and artists believed that they were part of a new golden age. Georgio Vasari, a sixteenth-century painter, architect, and writer, used "rebirth" to describe the era in which he lived.
The individualism was born during the Reaissance as peope sought to receive personal credit for their achievements.

>The Renaissance firstly took place in the vibrant Italian city-states. Eventually, the printing press invented in the mid-fifteenth century spread those cultural trends to other parts of Europe, which resulted in the creation of northern Renaissance. 
>>>While Italian Renaissance primarily had secular concerns, Northern Renaissance dealt with more religious concerns and ultimatey helped lay the foundation for the movement known as Protestant Reformation.
